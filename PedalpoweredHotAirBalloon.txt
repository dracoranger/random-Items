pedel powered hot air balloon
P=pRT

P=absolute pressure in Pa
p=density of gas in kg/m^3
R=gas constant in Joules/(kg*k)
T=absolute tempature in Kelvins

Normal atmospheric pressure = 101,300 Pa
Gas constant 287 Joules/kg*K

air inside ~100 C or 373K

101,300=  p*287*373

density of heated air = .946 kg/m^3

versus ~1.2kg/m^3 for cool air

each m^3 displaces .254 kg

For 90 kg, you'd need 355 m^3 of envalope

But this is only part of the weight of a hot air balloon

Generally most hot air balloons have 20 gallons of liquid propane
This weighs 4.2 pounds per gallon
84 lbs = 38.1 kg

Not sure what the standard size is for Australian propane canisters, but US uses 20 lbs
They weigh ~37 lbs when full, and hold 4.7 gallons
4 of them hold 18.8 gallons and weigh 148 lbs or 67 kg.

Burners weigh 22.7 kg, according to wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon#Combined_mass
You'll probably want a commercial version for safety's sake

I'm assuming that you're using a converted bike for the petal power.
Normal bikes weigh ~17.5 lbs, ~8 kilos, but I'll bump it up to 12 kilos for the addition of a fan, safety cage, and burner support.

Thus, the weight of the
person (90 kg)
fuel and tanks (38.1 kg)
burners (22.7 kg)
and bike/basket (12 kg)
equals 162.8 kg or 640 m^3 of displacement

Here's the annoying math, as increasing the size of the balloon's balloon increases the mass of the overall system, which needs a bigger balloon
1 square yard equals about 1.9 oz or .8361 meters^2 per 1.9 oz or .8361 meters^2 per .054 kg
1  meter ^2 = .064 kg
Using discrete values, because I refuse to actually solve for this equation when excel can do it for me
A perfectly spherical balloon of 5.7 meters in radius would be able to lift 197.04 kg, would add 27.05 kg, and would weight in total 188.9 kg.
So you'd have about 9 kg of weight for more supports for the burners and plumbing for the fuel.

I have no idea how much it would cost, and at the moment I am not inclined to find out.
